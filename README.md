# PHP Dump Checker

If you are like me, you always debug your code and sometimes, in a hurry, forget to remove them.
Linting in PHP can be pretty rough so you just want something minimal launched in pre-commit to tell you :
"Hey, you forgot a dump here ! Another one here ! This one is commented so this is good."

That's what this script does for you.
Enjoy.
